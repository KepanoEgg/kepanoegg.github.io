# Draft

Everyone in the league will be assigned a random draw number. The league will be at most 10 members. Every league member will get two draws (to encompass up to all 20 clubs in the league).

League members will draw in a snake method.
i.e. 1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1

# Trade

Your club picks will be yours for the remainder of the season. You may agree to trade with another league member.

- All trades must be approved by a majority of the league members not involved in the trade.
- Trading will be closed in the final 4 weeks of the 38 week season.

# Score

Each league member will choose one of their two clubs to play for that week.

When your club wins, you receive an amount of points equivilant to the inverse of their Win Probability.

i.e. If the Win Probability of your club is 65%, you receive 35 points (100 - 65 = 35).

In this manner, a good club will generally have a higher "Win Probability", for lower points, but will also likely win more often.

A bad club will generally have a lower "Win Probability", for higher points, but will also likely win less often

A draw will result in half the number of points you would have received for a win.

i.e. If the Win Probability of your club is 40%, you receive 30 points ((100 - 40)/2 = 30).

# Weekly Participation

All League members will choose one of their clubs for the week, and let the commisioner and/or the other league memebers know prior to the first of their two clubs playing. If no decision has been announced by the league member prior to the first of their two clubs playing, their decision will default to the team they choose the week prior.

# Win Probability

[Win Probability](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2021/09/10/what-is-the-premier-leagues-new-win-probability-statistic/) is an official stat generated by Oracle and recognized by the EPL. Win Probability is subject to change throught a week leading up to a match based on things like roster changes. It can also change throughout a match, but this will not affect fantasy points.

The stat used for league points will be gathered on Wednesday or Thursday prior to a weekend of play.
