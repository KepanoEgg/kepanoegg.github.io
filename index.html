I created this document from a combination of wiki.dothraki.org (which takes 20 seconds to a minute to load a page), some [blog posts](http://www.dothraki.com/) directly from David J. Peterson (the creator of the non-common languages), and a small handful of other resources I've found on the internet. wiki.dothraki often cites the lines as they were intended either from the books, or how they were written by DJP, so this document will not match what was originally subtitled in the show.

I apologize for any typos, or mistakes, as I'm bastardizing many other peoples' work. I did my best to seperate scenes based on the context of the dialogue and my rough memory of what was happening in the episode. I have cut out the original language transcripts, a lot of info about the subtleties of the language, and the production notes about why the language was spoken a certain way, or when someone misspoke because they weren't a native speaker. I have only left in a handful of notes where it may be confusing, or look like a mis-translation otherwise. If you would like more info on the lines, or to read the words in their spoken language, I would refer you back to wiki.dothraki.org.

As far as I can tell there are 4 distinct languages/dialects that should be addressed, and I'll do my best to show them as they are spoken, without interrupting the flow of this document. A fifth language is a single line, and knowing the speaker is a spoiler so I won't reveal it until it is spoken.

Dothraki - abbv DK  
High Valyrian - abbv HV
Meereenese Valyrian - abbv MV  
Astapori Valyrian - abbv AV  
Ex: ```Drogo [DK]: Test your might!```  
Drogo being the speaker, and [DK] meaning the line was spoken in Dothraki.

Rakharo [DK]: Slow? <br />

Crone [DK]: The prince rides. <br />

Drogo [DK]: I will give to him what he wants. <br />

<p>Drogo [DK]: The stallion that mounts the world has no need for iron chairs. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: According to the prophecy the stallion will ride to the ends of the world. <br />
Drogo [DK]: The earth ends at The Black Salt Sea. No horse can cross the poison water. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: The Earth never ends [at the sea]. There are many dirts across [the sea]. The dirts of my birth. <br />
Drogo [DK]: Not dirt. Lands. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Lands, yes. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: There are thousands of ships [in the free cities]. Wooden [horses] that fly across [the sea.] <br />
Drogo [DK]: Let's speak no more about wooden horses or iron chairs. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: It's not a chair. It's...it's...throne. <br />
Drogo [DK]: Throne? <br />
Daenerys [DK]: A chair for a king to sit upon...or a queen. <br />
Drogo [DK]: A khal doesn't need a chair to sit on. He only needs a steed.</p>

<h4 id="scene11-1">Scene 1.1</h4>

<p>Rakharo [DK]: Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold and silk and steel. <br />
Rakharo [DK]: She's a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why. <br />
Rakharo [DK]: Only while blood of my blood still lives. <br />
Mago [DK]: She is my prize. I will take her with an arakh.  </p>

<h4 id="scene12-1">Scene 1.2</h4>

<p>Mago [DK]: It's an insult! Khaleesi will give me my prize or I will take it with my arakh. <br />
Drogo [DK]: She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quiet. <br />
Drogo [DK]: Moon of my life, Mago says you have taken his spoils, a daughter of the lamb man who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day so they cannot be mounted. <br />
Drogo [DK]: This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: It pleases me to keep them safe. If your riders would mount them, let them take them as wives. <br />
Qotho [DK]: Does the horse mate with the lamb? <br />
Daenerys [DK]: The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike. <br />
Mago [DK]: You're a foreigner. You do not command me. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: I am Khaleesi. I do command you. <br />
Drogo [DK]: See how fierce she grows? That's my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire. <br />
Drogo [DK]: I will hear no more. Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock. <br />
Mago [DK]: A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal. <br />
Drogo [DK]: Be Still. Don't move. <br />
Drogo [DK]: I will not have you body burned. I will not give you that honor. <br />
Drogo [DK]: The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs. <br />
Drogo [DK]: The rain will fall on your rotting skin until nothing is left of you but bones. <br />
Mago [DK]: First you have to kill me. <br />
Drogo [DK]: I already have. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: My sun and stars is hurt. <br />
Drogo [DK]: A scratch, moon of my life. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Where are the healers. <br />
Drogo [DK]: This is the bite of a fly. <br />
Mirri Maaz Duur [DK]: I can help the great rider with his cut. <br />
Qotho [DK]: The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: She's mine. Let her speak. <br />
Qotho [DK]: Witch. <br />
Qotho [DK]: Too many words. The witch's words poison the ears. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Let her clean your wound my sun and stars. It makes me hurt to see you bleed.</p>

Drogo [DK]: My steed...My...steed. <br />
Haggo [DK]: Blood of my blood. <br />
Drogo [DK]: No, I must ride. <br />
Qotho [DK]: He fell from his horse. <br />
Qotho [DK]: A Khal who cannor ride is no khal. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: We have ridden far enough. We will camp here. <br />
Qotho [DK]: This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: We will camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it. Qotho... <br />
Qotho [DK]: You do not command me, Khallesi. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Find Mirri Maaz Duur. Bring her to me. <br />
Qotho [DK]: The witch? I will bring you her head khaleesi. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear you defied me.  </p>

<h4 id="scene12-2">Scene 1.2</h4>

<p>Drogo [DK]: Rides...By a yak...might trample...the black stork must... (This was ad-libbing by Jason Momoa that David Peterson created meaning for, basically Drogo was delirious) <br />
Qotho [DK]: You did this, witch. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Stop it. I don't want her hurt. <br />
Qotho [DK]: No? No? You don't want her hurt? <br />
Qotho [DK]: Pray we don't hurt you too. You let this witch put her hands on out Khal. <br />
Jorah [DK]: Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi. <br />
Qotho [DK]: Only while blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon. <br />
Qotho [DK]: The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi. <br />
Qotho [DK]: This must not be. This must not be. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: This must be. <br />
Qotho [DK]: Witch. <br />
Rakharo [DK]: Nothing good will come of this. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: No. You can't. <br />
Jorah [DK]: No further, horselord.  </p>

Daenerys [DK]: If you are still in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. I need you to fight now. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: When the star rises in the west and sets in the east...Then you will come back to me, my sun and stars.  </p>

Rakharo [DK]: What do we seek, khaleesi? <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers, or lakes, or the Great Salt Sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. <br />
Rakharo [DK]: Right away, let's go. <br />

Jorah, speaking common, explains argument ending with [DK]: He (Kovarro) can chop of as much as we can carry. <br />
Kovarro [DK]: Or melt it. Very simple. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: We are his guests! You can not pry it, nor chop it, nor melt it. <br />
Kovarro [DK]: Of course not, Khaleesi! We will await our departure. <br />

<p>Drogo [DK]: Moon of my life. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from before I could even… <br />
Daenerys [DK]: Maybe I am dead and I just don’t know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands. <br />
Drogo [DK]: Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you. <br />
Daenerys [DK]: That sounds like something that you would do. <br />
Drogo [DK]: Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream… I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms. <br />

Kraznys [AV]: She's worried about their nipples? Does the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls? Here, I'm done with you. <br />
Unsullied [AV]: This one is pleased to have served you. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before it's mother's eyes. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: This way we make certain their is no weakness left in them. <br />
Missandei [AV]: She is offended. She asks if you pay a silve coin to the mother, for her dead baby. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: What a soft mewling fool this one is. Tell her the silver is for the baby's owner, not the mother. <br />
Missandei [AV]: She asks how many Unsullied are for sale. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.</p>

<p>Missandei [AV]: She says again she wants all of them. She says she also wants all of the Unsullied in training.</p>

<p>Greizhen [AV]:  If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: The slut cannot pay for all of this. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: Her ship will buy 100 Unsullied, no more. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: And this because I like the curve of her ass. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: What is left will buy her 10. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: I will give her 20 if she stops her ignorant whimpering. <br />
Kraznys [AV]: So, ask this beggar queen, how will she pay for the remaining 7,877??  </p>

Kraznys [AV]: And, who knows? In ten years, some of those you've sent will be the Unsullied in their turn, so all shall prosper.  </p>

Daenerys [HV]: Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride. <br />
Grey Worm [AV]: ‘Grey Worm’ gives this one pride. It is a lucky name. <br />
Grey Worm [AV]: The name this one was born with was cursed. <br />
Grey Worm [AV]: That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. <br />

Thoros [HV]:You worship Him your way, and I’ll worship Him mine. Do you speak the Common Tongue?  </p>

<p>Episode 1 - The Red Woman
Tyrion and Varys, walking through the streets of Meereen, encounter an impoverished mother and child on the street. Tyrion offers her money.</p>

<p>Tyrion: Aōha rūho syt. Ipradon. "For your baby. To eat."[1]
As Varys points out, this is terrible Valyrian. Presumably the correct version would have been Aōho rūho syt. Ipradagon, or the like. As it stands, the meaning is something more like "For you baby. I wish to eat." Understandably the mother takes this to mean Tyrion wants to eat her baby.</p>

<p>Varys: Zȳha Valyria qupēgrie issa. Gēlȳri aōt tepagon jaelas, hegnīr aōhys rūs ipradagon kostos. "His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat."[1]
Varys's Valyrian is itself a bit off here. First of all, he says jaelas rather than the expected jaelza, but DJP has stated that this is a "preference," so perhaps not as wrong as we had previously believed. Gēlȳri also should be gēlȳndi—a plausible mistake for a native speaker to make, but a mistake nonetheless.[2]</p>

<p>Eventually they come across Zanrush, a red priest, addressing a crowd of Meereenese.</p>

<p>Zanrush: Āeksio Ōño jemot Muñe Zaldrīzoti jittas – se sȳndrori jorrāelis lȳr ozdakonot ziry dīntis. "The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you – and those who love the darkness chased her away."[1]
Zanrush: Skorkydoso udlilat? Belmondo bantāzma bōsa jemī qlādīlusy botilat? Ondossa jorhakēlāt, lykāpsirī Zaldrīzoti Muño amāzinon jumbari? "How will you respond? Will you let them drag you back into the long night of bondage? Will you wring your hands while you wait idly for the Mother of Dragons to return?"[1]
Zanrush: Iā jemēla zȳhys perzi ondurilat? Belma se pōnte sētessis lȳri nāpāstyri ozzālilāt? "Or will you take up her flames yourselves? Will you burn away the chains and the nonbelievers who make them?"[1]
Zanrush: Jemēlo kāerīnnon ivīlībilāt, lo sīr Dāria Daenerys jemī ivīlībagon kesīr īlos daor? Āeksia ossēnilat se– "Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you? Will you kill the–"[1]</p>

<p>Episode 2 - Home
Melissandre attempts to revive Jon Snow:</p>

<p>Melisandre: Zȳhys ōñoso jehikagon Āeksiot epi, se gīs hen sȳndrorro jemagon. "We ask the Lord to shine his light, and lead a soul out of darkness."[3]
Melisandre: Zȳhys perzys stepagon Āeksio Ōño jorepi, se morghūltas lȳs qēlītsos sikagon. "We beg the Lord to share his fire, and light a candle that has gone out."[3]
This should properly be Zȳhi perzi[3] and lī.[4]</p>

<p>Melisandre: Hen sȳndrorro, ōños. Hen ñuqīr, perzys. Hen morghot, glaeson. "From darkness, light. From ashes, fire. From death, life."[3]
She repeats this last line several times.</p>

<p>Episode 4 - Book of the Stranger
Tyrion attempts to greet Meereenese petitioners:</p>

<p>Tyrion: Nya roqirossa! Usovegon jemo syt jumbagon! "My friends! To apologize for you to wait!"[5]
This can barely be called HV, and does appear to incorporate some elements from AV.</p>

<p>Episode 5 - The Door
Tyrion meets with Kinvara.</p>

<p>Zanrush: Jehikarȳ Kinvaro iōrat, Eglio Vokto hen Rijībliot Volantihot, Drīvo Perzo, Sylvio Ōño, Dohaeriro Ēlio Āeksio Ōño syt. "You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."[6]
Tyrion: Va Mīrīnot jemī jiōran. "Welcome to Meereen."[6]
For once, Tyrion has the Valyrian exactly right.[7]</p>

<p>Episode 8 - No One
Tyrion and Varys again observe a Red Priestess preaching, this time the message is friendlier:</p>

<p>Priestess: Hen perzȳ vȳs amazverdagon asittaks. Lo zȳhyz zaldrīzesse Āeksiō Ōñō irudy Daenerot issi, sepār Daenerys Āeksiō irudy riñarta zȳhot issa. Lo Dārie se pāsābari sytiotāpia lōtirī jorrāeloty, sepār dōre vala arlī īlōn belmurilza. "From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Just as her dragons are a gift from the Lord of Light to Daenerys, so then is Daenerys a gift from the Lord to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again."[8]
Priestess: Lo īlva Dāria vīlībāzmo syt iōragon īlot epos, sepār zijo inkot memēbili. Se lyko syt īlot epos, īlvī ohīlvossa rughili. "When our Queen asks us to go to war, we march behind her. And when she asks us for peace, we throw down our knives."[8]
An unaired line, presumably from the scene where Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei attempt to share jokes:</p>

<p>Tyrion: Pirtiapos. "A joke."[8]</p>

Grey Worm and Missandei answer the petitioners' objections:</p>

<p>Grey Worm: Nyk skan minty, do jovenne. Y lu honesk ji kelnisto eji lysk – me dreji lysk – inki zer jéragho. "I am a soldier, not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace – a just peace – we should take it"[2]
MIssandei: Do pon pazan. Dori pon pazozlivan. Y he sylvie vala mere ivetredas, “Verdi ji lysk ilvi qrinuntys zy, do ilvi rageros zy.” "I do not trust them. I will never trust them. But as a wise man once said, 'We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.'"[2]
Episode 8: "No One"
An unaired line, presumably from the scene where Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei attempt to share jokes:</p>

<p>Missandei: Lárari. "Intimidating."[3]
Episode 9: "Battle of the Bastards"
Grey Worm offers the Masters' soldiers a choice:</p>

<p>Grey Worm: Jim vali ezi m’idreno. Ozvilívagho si morghúlegho Aeske zy sko do ozvilívizi si morghúlesi jim zy dori. Ja já lintot, va jivi kezari. "You men have a choice. Fight and die for Masters who would never fight and die for you. Or go home, to your families."[4]

Khal Moro: Ajjalan anha achilok ma yeroon, ma hash Vezhof erina, hash yer vayyoe anhaan rizhes. Hash yer tihoe? Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind you will give me a son. Do you understand?
Dany: Anha vos ochilok ma shafkoa vosecchi. M’anha vo vayyok vo yal che ha shafkea che h’eshnakaan. Avvos vosma shekh yola she jimma ma drivoe she titha. I will not lie with you. And I will bear no children, for you or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
Wife #1: Anha ast yeraan, me maegi. Zirisses nhare moon. I told you she is a witch. Cut off her head.
Khal Moro: Me allayafa anna. Athvadar mra qora. I like her. She has spirit.
Dany: Anha chiorikemoon ha Khalaan Drogo ki Bharbosi. I was wife to Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo.
Khal Moro: Khal Drogo driva. Khal Drogo is dead.
Dany: Anha nesak. Anha avvirsa khadokh moon. I know. I burnt his body.
Khal Moro: Anha nemo echomosak. Anha vo neso. Me izvena, jin athchilozar ma khaleenisoon. Vosak ofrakha yera vosecchi, anha astak yeraan asqoy. Forgive me. I did not know. It is forbidden to lie with a Khal’s widow. No one will touch you, you have my word.
Dany: Hash shafka vidrisofi anna Mirinaan, hash anha vammelisok mekhalasar shafki nem vazha dalen hrazef k’azhi anhoon. If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses as a sign of my gratitude.
Khal Moro: Hash khal drivoe, hash at gachi disse vekha ha khaleesisaan mae. When a khal dies, there is only place for his khaleesi.

Qhono: Hale, zhey Khaleesi Vezhven. Eyes choy. Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.
Khal Moro: Anha asshik yera vaesishoon, zhey Khaleesi. Welcome home, khaleesi.
Dosh Khaleen Priestess: Es. Go.
Dany: Fin yeri ti?! Eqorasas anna! Anha afichak anhaan nharees yeroa! Anha Mai Zhavorsi! Rizh anni Vezhoon Fin Saja Rhaesheseres! Anha chiorikem Khali Drogo! Zhey ivezho! What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads! I am the Mother of Dragons! My son was the Stallion Who Mounts the World! I am wife of Khal Drogo! You beasts!
Dany: Yeri ray esh osoon. Ki jini yeri akhezhi. Anha chiorikem Khali Vezhvena. You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
Dosh Khaleen Priestess: Kisha shilaki yera. Anha vineserak meyer adakh zhores vezhoon. (beat) Kifindirgi yer vos esso kishaan irge Khal Drogo drivo? We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. (beat) Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
Dany: Hajinaan m’anha Deneris Vazyol, Haggey-Assamvak, Khaleesi Mirini ma Mai Zhavorsi. Vaes anni vos jinne ma shafkoa. Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you.
Dosh Khaleen Priestess: Ishish yer jili. (beat) Yer chiorikemoon Khali Vezhvena. Yer shillo memé vassila rhaesheseres ma yeroon qisi. Yer shillo meyer vayyoli Vezhes Fin Saja Rhaesheseres. (beat) Me vo to. Yer vo to. (beat) Anha chiorikemoon Khali Vezhvena. Maybe you’re right. (beat) You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. You thought you would give birth to the Stallion Who Mounts the World. (beat) He didn’t. You didn’t. (beat) I was the wife of the Great Khal.
Dosh Khaleen Priestess: Khal Savo. Anha shillo memé vassila rhaesheseres m’anhoon qisi. Hash yer ray char astosoris mae? Vos. Yer vo charo mora vosecchi. (beat) Yer imeshi.

I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. Have you heard the stories about him? No. You haven’t. (beat) You’re young. We were all young, once. Some of us still are. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.
Dany: Finnaan anha vek? Ei khaleesi Doshaan Khaleen. Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
Dosh Khaleen Priestess: Sek. Irge leshiti athdrivari khali mae. Vosma yer vos. Yer ver yomme rhaesheser. Reki izvena.

You went out into the world. That is forbidden. (beat) All the khalasars have returned to the ancient city for the Khalar Vezhven, where they will meet to discuss their plans for the coming winter. They will decide which cities will be sacked, which tribes will be enslaved, and which ones destroyed. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. (beat) With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.
Episode 4 - Book of the Stranger
The streets of Vaes Dothrak.</p>

<p>Iggo: Yer fich jinnaan loy nayati Saathoon? You bring any girls home from Saath?
Akho: Mm, zheanish norethqoyi. Mm, a little beauty with red hair.
Iggo: Ma hash rizh yeri norethqoyik? What if you have a son with red hair?
Akho: Anha vovvethak mae ashefasaan. I’ll throw him in the river.
Jorah: Zhey okeosi anni… Kisha nemo silish Jereseroon Jima majin leisosh. Hash shafka laz idrie kisha rekkaan akka? My friends… We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
Akho: Fin yer vijereri? What do you sell?
Jorah: Sewafikh. Jadi vaesaan anni asshekh, anha vazhak shafkea khogare avezhvenanaza Halahisiroon. Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give a cask of the Arbor’s finest.
Akho: Yeri vos jeraki. (to Iggo) Hales eshnakis. You’re not merchants. (to Iggo) Get the others.
Iggo: Rhelas! Rhelas! Help! Help!
The temple of the Dosh Khaleen.</p>

<p>High Priestess: Loy mori vo dirgi me-Dothraki jif vigoveri ifakis. Mori vo dirgi meqoy jifim ayyoza. Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They don’t think the blood should be diluted.
High Priestess: Mori vikeesisi toki. Mori vo tihoo mekisha ray ayyoz qoy kishoon ayyeyoon. Kisha assilaki yanqosores, kisha qoraki chiories adavranazi, mori ayyoe yal kishaan. Kijinosi kisha zin hajaki. They are stupid old women. They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood. We conquer a people, we take the best women, they bear us children. That’s how we stay strong.
High Priestess: Jinak Lazari. Khal mae ez mae aresaya she dirke irge memé avvirsa vaesish mae nakhaan. Fini thirisir yeri arrek? This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?
Ornela: Akatthi. 12.
High Priestess: Irge firesofi, me ayyo khalaan mae ohar. Me’th allayaf mae sekosshi. Kifinosi me qach athlayafar mae? A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter. He must have been so happy. How did he show his happiness?
Ornela: Me assamve serje. He broke my ribs.
High Priestess: Kisha vos khaleesisi jinne. Kisha vos ch’assiloki vaes che dothroki zhavors. Vosma vo khezhos. Khali jadi kishaan haji athvillaroon. Atthirar kishi annevae shorhae. Ma kisha ma kishoon akka. We are not queens, here. We do not conquer cities or ride dragons. But do not despair. The khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning. And we have each other.
Dany: Hazi ale khadosoon. That is more than most have.
High Priestess: Kash Khali jadoe haji Khalaroon Vezhvena, kash anha zalak memori azhi yeraan thirat asshekhis yeri nakhaan ma kishoon. Eshna osi vo laini vosso. When the Khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant.
Dany: Ma Khalar Vezhven silokh sh’ajjalan? (off the Priestess’ nod) Anha zigerek athnavaroon. And the Khalar Vezhven is tomorrow night? (off the Priestess’ nod) I need to make water.
High Priestess: Yer laz vo choqi Dothrakoa vosecchi. Yer nesi jin. You can’t run from Dothraki. You know this.
Dany: Anha vos ochoqak Dothrakoa vosecchi. I will never run from Dothraki.
High Priestess: Es, idris mae. Go, show her.
Dany and Ornela exit.</p>

<p>Dany: Anha zigere yash chosha. I needed fresh air.
Dany: Yesisi vachrari. The old women stink.
Ornela: Mori vachrari sekosshi. They do stink.
Dany: Mori’th samvenosh kash Khal yeri drivo, jin firesof yeri. You must have been very young when your Khal died.
Ornela: Zhindatthi. Sixteen.
Dany: Me ohazha memé vo drivo k’athaqisinari. Too bad he didn’t die sooner.
Ornela: Sek, me ohazha. Yes, too bad.
Ornela: Hash me jila, jin sen zhavorsi mra qora? Is it true you have three dragons?
Ornela: Ma mori leshita ki vorsasi? And they breathe fire?
Dany: Mori ti kijinosi sekosshi. Hash me vallayafa yera tihat mora hezhahhe? They do. Would you like to see them one day?
Ornela: Anha Dosh Khaleen. Anha laz vos odinak Vaesoon Dothrak vosecchi, vosm’anha ayothak vorsqoyoon ven fih kash anha adrivok. I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, unless I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.
After Jorah and Daario ambushed Ornela.</p>

<p>Dany: Ma yer… Qothas k’anni, zhey khaleesi. Vos yer nem holos anhoon. And you… Have faith in me, khaleesi. Do not betray me.</p>

<p>The Khals discuss the deaths of Akho and Iggo.</p>

<p>Green Khal: Hrazef shafki nokittish mahrazhes anni zhey Iggo. Me akkoal hrazef k’athadavranazi ei mahrazhoa khalasari anni. Your horses trampled my man Iggo. He was better at healing horses than any man in my khalasar.
Moro: Mori nokittish akka mahrazhes anni zhey Akho. K’athodavranari, anha aran m’akat lamees ma vezhes. Fini adavrana: che m’akat lamesi ma vezh che akat mahrazhi ven toki ven mori nem nokittish ki hrazefi? Hiles mora nakhaan. Shafka jif hoeri hrazef anni. They also trampled my man Akho. Even worse, I lost two mares and a stallion. What’s worth more: two mares and a stallion, or two men dumb enough to get trampled by horses? Fuck them both. You should thank my horses.
Forzho: Me izvena, jin athaqqiyazar she vaesof. It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city.
Moro: Me izvena, jin athkessezar az she vaesof. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
Forzho: Majin kisha vos addrekoki qoy moon! So we don’t spill blood!
Moro: Hazaan… Loyi qoyi avekha ayyey. Well… There’s always a little blood.
Forzho: Ato kaffe nharees moon ki negwini– Someone crushed his head with a rock–
Brozho: Aggo nem vos addrivo k’azi vosecchi. Aggo was not killed with a blade.
Forzho: Vosma qoy moon nem addrek. But his blood was spilled.
Brozho: Loyi qoyi avekha ayyey. There is always some blood.
Forzho: Vos hash me avarraggera mae. Not when you strangle them.
Rhalko: Che hash me vassamva lent. Or break their neck.
Forzho: Che hash me vacchorka mae ki janeti majin me anokitta mae ki hrazefi. Me nem nesa k’assokhosori me– Or roll them in a rug and trample them with a horse. The law states that–
Moro: Aggo dothra ma khalasaroon anni. Me sili anna chek. Nhare moon nem kaf ki negwini. Hiles Aggoes. Aggo belonged to my khalasar. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.
Moro: Fichi khaleenies Drogosi. Bring in Drogo’s widow.
Daenerys is introduced before them.</p>

<p>Brozho: Fin nem olda ki mae? Me lentashi. Who cares about her? She’s a midget.
Porrzho: Me allayafa anna. I like her.
Brozho: Me azasqana lamekhoon. She’s paler than milk.
Porrzho: Anha azhik memé vafazhoe rivaan kash me nem athacha. I bet she gets nice and pink when you pinch her.
Rhalko: Anha zalak nesat ven fini ven athyazhar khaleesisi. I’d like to know what a Khaleesi tastes like.
Porrzho: Athdavrazar. Shafka laz addiwee khirrof anni. Good. You can suck my dick.
Moro: Me jif dothrae Doshi Khaleen. She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
Qorro: Aiske Silve Yunkayoon zali mae. Mori vazhi ha thi dalen hrazefaan ha maan. Fini adavrana: ch’at nayati hannaven che thi dalen hrazef? The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They’re offering ten thousand horses in exchange. What’s worth more: one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?
Moro: Hiles Aiske Silve vi choyokh dave. Asti anhaan rekke hrazef mori majin anha aqorak mora h’anhaan zhorre. Me jif vikovarera jinne. Me oskimikh kishi. Me zigeree Doshoon Khaleen. Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. Tell me where their horses are and I’ll take them for myself. She should stay here. It’s our tradition. She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
Dany: Hash yeri vo zali nesat rek dirgak anha? Don’t you want to know what I think?
Moro: Yer zali meyer nem vazhi ven zafra? Che ishish me vallayafa yera attihat zhey Rhalkoes athyazharoon yeri? You’d rather be sold into slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
Dany: Vos, anha vo zalok vos at rek osoon. No, I don’t want either of those things.
Moro: Me vos oldo kisha, jin athzalar yeri. Jini vaesof Doshi Khaleen. Vos fothakhi vekho ha yeraan jinne, vosma yer Dosh Khaleen–ma yer vos, vosma kisha vokkeraki mae. We don’t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.
Dany: Anha nesak rekke anha kovarak. Anha ray dothra jinne hatif ajjin. Hazze, she haz sorfo, anha adakh zhores vezhoon. Ma Dosh Khaleen hake yal anni Vezh Fin Saja Rhaesheseres. I know where I am. I have been here before. Right there, on that spot, I ate a stallion’s heart. And the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
Moro: Ma fini meliso? Yer shille maege, ven tokik. Enta yeri driva haji yeroon. Majin Khal Drogo akka. And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.
Dany: Jinne zhey Drogo ast asqoy vidrie khalasares mae jim, finnaan nakhoe rhaesheser. Dothralat hrazef ido yomme Havazzhifi Kazga ven et vo khal avvos. This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the black salt sea as no khal has done before.
Dany: Me ast asqoy addrivat mahrazhis fini ondee khogar shiqethi ma ohharat okrenegwin mori. Me ast asqoy anhaan. Hatif Maisi Krazaaji, kash shieraki vitihir asavvasoon. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore it to me. Before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars looked down in witness.
Moro: Ma yer ven toki ven yer shillo mae. And you were dumb enough to believe him.
Dany: Ma jinne, ajjin, fin vaese zhokwa jerie Khali Vezhveni? Fin vaesish vemrasoe yeri, finsanney nayat vil ahilee yeri, finsanney hrazef aqaffi yeri k’azhi. And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute.
Dany: Yeri mahrazhi zhikwi. Torga yeri, Dothraki yanqosoraan zhikwi. Vos at yeroa venoe idrilat mora vosecchi. You are small men. Under you, the Dothraki will be a small people. None of you is fit to lead them.
Dany: Vosma anha venok. Majin anha vidrik. But I am. So I will.
Moro: Athgoshar. Vos Dosh Khaleen ha yeraan. Athvokkerar yeri. Ha rekaan, ha jinaan, kisha ahileki yera k’athmajizari. Majin kisha vazhaki dothrakhqoyoon kishi hilelat yera. All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Your choice. Instead, we’ll take turns fucking you. And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you.
Moro: Majin hash zhille athzinari yeri vekha, hash kisha vazhaki ekh hrazefaan kishi. Hash yer ray tih kifinosi hilee hrazef chiories? Jini vekhikh fin eth tihi yer hatif yer drivoe. Ma yer atihi mae. Hatif yer drivoe zhorre. And if there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn. Have you ever seen what a horse does to a woman? This is a thing you should see before you die. And you will. Right before you die.
Moro: Zhey gech yofi. Hash yer shillo k’athjilari mekisha asilaki yera? You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?
Dany: Yeri vos osili vosecchi. Yeri vadrivoe. You’re not going to serve. You’re going to die.
Episode 6 - Blood of My Blood
Daario: Anha adothrak maan. Ayos anna jinne. I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
Dany: Ei khal fin thir nakhaan okke sen dothrakhqoy aloji qisi mae m’avijazeri athdinar mae. Vosma anha vos khal. Every khal who ever lived chose three bloodriders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal.
Dany: Anha vo vokkak sen dothrakhqoy. Anha okkak ei yeri. I will not choose three bloodriders. I choose you all.
Dany: Anha qafak asqoy yeroa, majin yeri m’athiri m’adrivoe ven qoy qoyi, m’adothrae anni m’avijezeri anna athzhowakaroon. I ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.
Dothraki: Qoy qoyi! Qoy qoyi! Blood of my blood! Blood of my blood!
Dany: Anha aqafak san ale yeroa ei Khaloon ray qaf khalasaroon mae! I will ask more of you than any Khal has ever asked of his khalasar!
Dany: Hash yeri adothrae hrazef ido yomme Havazzhifi Kazga? Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
Dany: Hash yeri vaddrivi dozge anni ma khogaroon shiqethi mori majin vohhari okrenegwin mori? Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
Dany: Hash yeri vazhi anhaan Rhaeshis Andahli, jin azho me-Khal Drogo ast asqoy mehas hatif Maisi Krazaaji kash shieraki vitihir asavvasoon? Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains as the stars looked down in witness?
Dany: Hash yeri m’anhoon, ma jinne m’ayyeyaan?! Are you with me, now and always?!</p>

<h2 id="season7hv">Season 7 HV</h2>

<p>Episode 2 - Stormborn
Melisandre meets with Daenerys for the first time:</p>

<p>Melisandre: Dārȳs Daenerys. Dohaeriros istin, sindita liortā, qilonta ozbartā. Riglose Belmot Pryjatys rhaenan. "Queen Daenerys. I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."[1]
Belmot Pryjatys is an outright error: it should be either Belmo Pryjati or Belmoti Pryjati.</p>

<p>Daenerys: Meli Voktyssy Mīrīnī lyks mazverdagon beldis. Kesīr drējī jiorilaks. Skoroso jemele brōzia? "The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?"[1]
According to DJP, Dany uses jemele here, rather than aōle out of politeness (though he adds HV does not have a full-blown T–V distinction). Curiously, she still says brōzia rather than brōziat.</p>

<p>Melisandre: Melisandrose brōziks. "I am called Melisandre."[1]
Daenerys: Bosys bantis amāzis, se morghor zijomy amāzis. Meri kīvio dārilaros ōz maghagon kostas. "The long night is coming, and the dead come with it. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn."[1]</p>

Grey Worm announces Melisandre:</p>

<p>Grey Worm: Yn ilirí, nya dare. Me vohty mili hin Asshai o pindas m’odhir. "Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from Asshai begs a word."[5]
This line was delivered in English in the final episode.</p>

<p>Missandei knocks on Grey Worm's door:</p>

<p>Grey Worm: Mají. "Enter." [5]
Episode 3: "The Queen's Justice"
The Unsullied take Casterly Rock:</p>

<p>Grey Worm: Dory umbas. "There are none left."[6]
Grey Worm: Inkas hónesko sidri hin bezi. Kara sidri. "There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.[6]
Unsullied Lieutenant: Torgo Nudho! "Grey Worm!"[6]
Grey Worm: Skure las v’umbor espo Lanisteri? "Where are the rest of the Lannisters?"[6]
This line was delivered in English in the final episode, which makes sense because, as shot, it was addressed to a Lannister soldier.</p>
